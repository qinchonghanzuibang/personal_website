                    <p>
                        <strong>Jonathan Qin</strong>, a passionate and innovative <span class="highlight">software developer</span>, currently pursuing a dual degree in <strong>Computer Science and Finance</strong> at <span class="highlight">The University of Hong Kong</span>. With a keen interest in technology and problem-solving, I have honed my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, building responsive and user-friendly web applications.<br>
                        My journey in coding began at a young age, and I have since participated in various <span class="highlight">hackathons</span> and <strong>coding competitions</strong>, earning accolades for creativity and technical prowess. I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.<br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy <strong>reading</strong>, exploring new <span class="highlight">programming languages</span>, and contributing to open-source projects. I'm always open to collaboration and excited to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world.
