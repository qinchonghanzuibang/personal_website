                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a sophomore at The University of Hong Kong, studying Computer Science and Finance.
                        I aimed to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building this personal website. 
                        <br><br>
                        I am quite into badminton, swimming, and portraiting. Also a huge fan of travelling. 
                        My childhood dream of becoming a game designer has been called into question by the course I am taking during the Berkeley summer session. 
                        (CS61BL, I am talking about you!).
                        Designing games was both enjoyable and painful.
